Changes from 0.5-10 to 0.6-0
============================

1.  Updated for the fact that R graphics engine now supports
    complex paths.

    Removed grid.path() and pathGrob() from this package
    (now in 'grid' package)

    Removed svgGrobify() 
    (the normal grobify() in 'grImport' now handles complex paths)

    Tweaked passage of 'grid' pathgrob through generic device to
    SVG device.
    

Changes from 0.5-8 to 0.5-10
===========================

1.  conversion of gpar() to SVG CSS now recognises 'fillrule'
    (so that pathgrobs [and polgyons] can specify "nonzero" or "evenodd")

2.  svgGrobify() passes object@rule from PictureFill objects
    to gpar() so that 'fill' and 'eofill' from imported images
    will be represented by appropriate paths in SVG.

3.  The current locale encoding (i.e., the encoding used to
    write the SVG file) is now recorded in the SVG file.


Changes from 0.5-3 to 0.5-8
===========================

1.  Added 'redraw' argument to grid.garnish()

2.  Improved sizing of text 
    (especially when it is controlled via 'cex')

3.  Correction for rotated text 
    (SVG measures angles clock-wise)

4.  Improved recording of SVG 'style' attribute so that it
    handles vectorized settings better.

5.  Improved recording of 'lty' setting in SVG output.

6.  Forced ALL gpar settings from grid to SVG output
    (i.e., no longer have to EXPLICITLY set gpars).

7.  Added checks for XML specials when producing SVG output.

8.  Improved sizing of text (and line widths) to be responsive
    to device resolution.

9.  Added grid.path() and pathGrob() which can be used to draw 
    polygons with holes (when producing SVG output).

10. Added svgGrobify() which uses pathGrob() when converting
    a Picture from 'grImport' to grobs.


Changes from 0.3 to 0.4
=========================

1.  Updated properly for R 2.0.0

    Hyperlinks work the same as before, but Animation now works 
    differently:  you animate an entire grob rather than an
    individual unit.

2.  Integrated changes from Nathan Whitehouse and colleagues to
    support arbitrary SVG attributes and script chunks.

3.  SVG shape chunks now use grid grob names for the id attribute.

    If more than one chunk is produced, then a 1:n suffix is attached.
    For example, grid.circle(r=1:4/8, name="circgrob") produces four
    <circle> chunks with id's "circle1" to "circle4", but 
    grid.rect(name="rectgrob") produces a single <rect> chunk with
    id "rectgrob".

4.  Added NAMESPACE.


Changes from 0.2-1 to 0.3
=========================

1.  Minimal update to get version that runs with grid in R 1.9.*


Changes from 0.2 to 0.2-1
=========================

1.  Changed implementation of lpaste from recursive to loop
    (to avoid "evaluation nested too deeply" problems)

2.  Fixed up [cx|cy].time.unit for case where only one of x|y
    is a "time.unit".  Used to not replicate the "normal" unit
    correctly.
