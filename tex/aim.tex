\chapter{Aim}

The intention of this project is to produce animated and interactive plots on web pages.
These plots can convey more information and engage a reader better than regular static graphics.
Currently, the creation of these plots is not possible in \R{} without encountering some difficulty.
A package for \R{} exists that can create the type of plots we want, but it is not capable of producing all but the most basic of statistical graphics.
This package, \gridSVG{}, needed to be improved upon in order to create useful animated and interactive graphics.
The \gridSVG{} package required extending so that it is able to generate plots that are sufficiently similar to those that are produced by \R{}.
